Since September 2022, I am an Associate Professor at the [√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise (ensIIE)](https://www.ensiie.fr/) in Evry (France), a city in the south-east suburb of Paris. I am in charge of the HPC track (so called CIDM) at ensIIE. I am also the coordinator of the first semester of the engineering program.
I teach in various courses of the 1st year, and I am giving an advanced course in 3rd year on scheduling and performance analysis (see [Teaching](teaching.html) page for more details).

I am a member of the [SAMOVAR](https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/?lang=fr) laboratory of T√©l√©com SudParis, doing my research in the wonderdul [Benagil](https://team.inria.fr/benagil/) joined team between SAMOVAR and Inria Saclay.

From Nov. 2020 to June 2022, I was a post-doc at the CC-IN2P3 in Villeurbanne, working in the [CCLab](https://cclab.pages.in2p3.fr/web/) group under the direction of [Fr√©d√©ric Suter](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/frederic-suter) (now Senior Scientist at Oak Ridge National laboratory).

From Nov. 2017 to Oct. 2020, I was a PhD student under the guidance of the great [Brice Goglin](http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/goglin/)
and [Guillaume Pallez (Aupy)](http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/gaupy/#About).
I was part of the  [TADaam](https://team.inria.fr/tadaam/) team in the [Inria Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest Research Center](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux).

I successfully defended my PhD on October 15th, 2020 in Amphitheater A of Building A29 in University of Bordeaux.
The manuscript is freely accessible [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03003808), and the slides [here](documents/presentation_th√®se.pdf).
I was funded by the University of Bordeaux (French Ministry of Research grant), and affiliated to the [LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr/).

# Research

I am interested in various scheduling and resource partitioning problems related in the domain of distributed computing and high performance computing (HPC).
I am interested in optimizing the execution of applications, and understand the problems application users face when running their code on large-scale platforms.

During my PhD, I mixed theoretical studies and experimentation to design models and approximation algorithms in order to propose cost-efficient scheduling strategies for various types of applications.

Since 2023, I am working on performance analysis for large-scale applications in the PEPR [NumPEx](https://numpex.org/fr/) project.

In addition, I also work on large-scale storage, in particular on how to efficiently use magnetic tape storage.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate or discuss on these topics!!

# Teaching duties and responsibilities

I am teaching various courses at ensIIE. I am giving tutorials and practical sessions of almost all computer science modules of the first semester.
I am also giving an advanced course in the fifth semester about performance of distributed systems, introducing theory and applied scheduling in distributed computing, in addition to performance analysis of distributed applications.

For more details, please refer to the [teaching](teaching.html) page.

Since Sept. 2024, I am the head of the CIDM track, organized in partnership with the CEA. This track offers an advanced and complete program about HPC, BigData and Quantum computing.
A full program description is available [here](https://www.ensiie.fr/formation).

From Sept. 2025, I will hold the Teaching Chair "Technologies avanc√©es et √©mergentes pour la Souverainet√© num√©rique" between ensIIE and CEA.
